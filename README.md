# EINFLUSSPUNKT / Influential dots

![The algorithm in action](Algorithmus5.2.png)

## Abstract
Seven particles start at once and fall down due to a gravity force. Additionally, there are three dots of different sizes that exert a repelling force on the particles. After a short time, the particles stop and their path becomes visible.

## Dependencies
[P5.js](http://p5js.org/) _"The power of Processing times the reach of JavaScript"_

## Usage
There are four Javascript files (plus an html file):
- **sketch.js**: the mother ship
- **particle:system.js**: the particle system
- **particle.js**: each single particle
- **repeller.js**: each single repeller

I encourage you to read Daniel Shiffman's [chapter about particle systems](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/) and visit [his repositories on GitHub](https://github.com/shiffman/The-Nature-of-Code-Examples/tree/master/chp04_systems/NOC_4_07_ParticleSystemForcesRepeller).

## Thanks
I would like to thank Daniel Siffman from [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) and his wonderful [chapter about particle systems](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/). And I wouldn't have been able to do this without hte help of [Fabian Morón Zirfas](https://github.com/fabiantheblind).
