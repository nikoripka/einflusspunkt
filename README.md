# EINFLUSSPUNKT / Influential dots

![The algorithm in action](Algorithmus5.2.png)

## Abstract
Seven particles start at once and fall down due to gravity force. Additionally, there are three dots of different sizes that have a repelling force on the particles. After a short time, the particles stop and their path becomes visible.

## Dependencies
[P5.js](http://p5js.org/) "the power of Processing times the reach of JavaScript"

## Thanks
I would like to thank Daniel Siffman from [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/) and his helpful [chapter about particle systems](http://natureofcode.com/book/chapter-4-particle-systems/).
